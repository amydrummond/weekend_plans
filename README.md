# weekend_plans

This will contain the data and code for "What should we do this weekend?"  This is intially a "where should we hike this weekend?" based on Hiking Upward, National Parks and Monuments, and the weather, starting in DC.

Thoughts of things it should eventually do: 
* On a website, collect the GPS coordinates of the user in order to make localized recommendations
* take in information from EveryTrail as well
* Museums
* Historic monuments
* Toggle for distance from current location
* Collect GPS coordinates in order to identify nearby hotels -- can I get pet-friendly?
* Hook up to Yelp for best regional activities and restaurants in the area
