# weekend_plans

This will contain the data and code for "What should we do this weekend?"  This is intially a "where should we hike this weekend?" based on Hiking Upward, National Parks and Monuments, and the weather, starting in DC.

Thoughts of things it should eventually do: 
* On a website, collect the GPS coordinates of the user in order to make localized recommendations
* Compare elevation to other areas to determine if there's flat, hill, mountain, or plateau. Is there anything else we can create with this? Shoreline? Water? Perhaps get water area from Census Tract, or similar? And maybe get some shoreline by getting the west and eastmost locations for particular lines of latitude?
* take in information from EveryTrail as well
* Museums
* Historic monuments
* Toggle for distance from current location
* Collect GPS coordinates in order to identify nearby hotels -- can I get pet-friendly?
* Hook up to Yelp for best regional activities and restaurants in the area
