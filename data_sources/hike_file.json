It is the only trail at Grand Canyon National Park that so dramatically holds true to a &lt;br /&gt;<br />ridgeline descent. But this exhilarating sense of exposure to the vastness of the canyon comes at a cost: there is &lt;br /&gt;<br />little shade and no water for the length of this trail. During winter months, the constant sun exposure is likely to &lt;br /&gt;<br />keep most of the trail relatively free of ice and snow. For those who insist on hiking during summer months, which &lt;br /&gt;<br />is not recommended in general, this trail is the quickest way to the bottom (it has been described as &quot;a trail in a &lt;br /&gt;<br />hurry to get to the river&quot;), but due to lack of any water sources, ascending the trail can be a dangerous &lt;br /&gt;<br />proposition.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />When camping at Bright Angel Campground, many hikers prefer to hike down the South Kaibab Trail and &lt;br /&gt;<br />up the Bright Angel Trail. Though the South Kaibab Trail has an almost identical maximum grade &lt;br /&gt;<br />compared to the Bright Angel, it is more consistently sloped but does not have water or shade. The hike &lt;br /&gt;<br />down South Kaibab Trail typically takes 4-6 hours. &lt;br /&gt;<br /> &lt;br /&gt;<br />The trail begins with a series of tight switchbacks. This is where ice will most likely be encountered during &lt;br /&gt;<br />the winter months. After these initial switchbacks, the trail traverses below Yaki Point to the aptly named &lt;br /&gt;<br />Ooh Ah Point (the first panoramic view of the canyon). From Ooh Ah Point on, the trail follows the top of a &lt;br /&gt;<br />ridgeline and is consequently without shade. Several broad and steeply-plunging switchbacks later, hikers &lt;br /&gt;<br />reach Cedar Ridge. There are pit toilets at Cedar Ridge, but no water or emergency phone. &lt;br /&gt;<br /> &lt;br /&gt;<br />From Cedar Ridge, the South Kaibab Trail traverses below O'Neill Butte without a single switchback to &lt;br /&gt;<br />Skeleton Point. At three miles from the rim, Skeleton Point is the maximum distance recommended for a &lt;br /&gt;<br />day hike. The trail goes directly off the end of Skeleton Point and here, where the trail has been blasted &lt;br /&gt;<br />directly out of the limestone cliffs, hikers will encounter the most dramatic sense of exposure. The trail &lt;br /&gt;<br />descends rapidly via a series of switchbacks to the Tonto Platform and Tipoff. There are pit toilets and an &lt;br /&gt;<br />emergency phone at Tipoff, but no water. For hikers who will be utilizing the Tonto Trail to the east or &lt;br /&gt;<br />west, the intersection is located fifty feet or so up-trail from the pit toilets. &lt;br /&gt;<br /> &lt;br /&gt;<br />Below Tipoff, the South Kaibab Trail loosely follows the course of an earlier trail called the Cable Trail &lt;br /&gt;<br />(built in 1907 to accommodate access to the old cable car system across the river that existed before &lt;br /&gt;<br />construction of the present suspension bridge). Vestiges of this earlier trail can be seen as the South &lt;br /&gt;<br />Kaibab Trail descends toward the Colorado River.

Whether you prefer to wander the property's eastern border along the lake shoreline or ascend to an overlook for a westward panorama, Weir Hill Reservation will replenish body and soul. <br /><br />Follow the 0.75-mile Edgewood Farm Trail to reach the meandering shore of Lake Cochichewick, which dominates the east and south edges of this reservation. The two-mile-long lake and Weir Hill (&quot;wire hill&quot;) are the dominant natural features in the northeast part of town and easily its most scenic. In fact, Great Pond Road was laid out on the east shore to take advantage of the views across the lake and the hill rising just beyond. Cochichewick has long served as North Andover's drinking water supply, so public access remains limited. Hikers of the Edgewood Farm and 0.4-mile Cochichewick trails can feel fortunate as they wander, enjoying terrific water-level views. Take caution if you trek this route in winter, though, as these trails get icy!<br /><br />For a quite different, but equally memorable experience, take the 0.71-mile Stevens Trail up the spine of Weir Hill to where a scenic overlook opens on the right. Hikers enjoy a broad panorama of the Merrimack Valley spreading below. On days of good visibility, you can see Mount Wachusett rising in the distance beyond Worcester, and northwest of Wachusett, New Hampshire's Mount Monadnock. <br /><br />Generations of agricultural use, a history of fire, and cutting and mowing regimes have created a patchwork landscape on Weir Hill that supports ten different types of plant communities, from a 60-acre oak-hickory forest to hillside seeps, intermittent streams, and wet meadows. Several threatened state-listed and watch-listed species can be found on Weir Hill, including the white bog orchid (Habenaria dilitata), violet bush clover (Lespedeza violacea), butternut trees (Juglans nigra)."}], "country": "United States", "lon": 0.0, "parent_id": null, "state": "Massachusetts", "directions": "From I-93 Exit 41, take Rt. 125 North 7.3 mi.
